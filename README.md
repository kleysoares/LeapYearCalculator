# LeapYearCalculator

This was my first project in college. I have to confess Java, for me, was the snake game on Nokia mobile phones only.

I enhanced it a bit but it is still very crude. After all, I still have a lot to learn.

The program asks for a year and checks whether it is a leap year or not. Then, it prints a calendar.

Feel free to help me place the days in the right day of the week according to the last day of the previous month, because the first day of each month falls on Sunday no matter what =)

Thank you for visiting my repository.
